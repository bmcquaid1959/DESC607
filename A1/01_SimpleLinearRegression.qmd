I.  Introduction
    A.  Brief explanation of regression analysis
    B.  Purpose of the analysis
        1. Understanding the Research Question
        2. Identifying the research question that requires a linear regression analysis
        3. Determining the dependent variable (response variable) and independent variable (predictor variable)
    C.  Description of the dataset
    D.  Data Collection and Variable Measurement
        1. Gathering relevant data for the analysis
        2. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data
        3.Measurement scales for variables (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)
II. Data Exploration
    A.  Summary statistics
    B.  Descriptive statistics for variables
        1. Data visualization (scatter plots, histograms)
    C.  Identify potential outliers or influential points
III. Model Specification
    A.  Definition of variables (dependent and independent)
    B.  Formulation of the simple linear regression model
        1. Understand why a simple linear regression model is appropriate
        2. Consider the nature of the relationship between variables
    C.  Assumptions of the simple linear regression model
        1. Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear
        2. Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X
        3. Independence: Observations are independent of each other
        4. Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed
IV. Model Estimation
    A.  Use of statistical software (e.g., R, Python, or others)
    B.  Estimation of model parameters (slope and intercept)
        1. Checking and ensuring linearity in the relationship
        2. Introducing interaction terms when relevant
    C.  Assessment of the model fit (e.g., R-squared value)
V.  Interpretation of Results
    A.  Significance of model parameters
    B.  Interpreting the slope and intercept in the context of the problem
    C.  Hypothesis testing for the significance of the model
VI. Model Diagnostics
    A.  Residual analysis
        1. Checking for homoscedasticity
        2. Examining normality of residuals
        3. Detecting influential points
    B.  Checking for multicollinearity (if applicable)
    C.  Addressing potential issues identified in the diagnostics
        1. Functional Form
        2. Choosing the appropriate functional form for the relationship
        3. Discussing when to transform variables (e.g., log transformations)
VII. Conclusion 
    A. Summary of key findings
    B. Limitations of the analysis 
    C. Suggestions for future research or improvements to the model
